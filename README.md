# DungeonJumper
Procedurally Generated 2D Game

---

I wrote DungeonJumper in high school in my free time. There are a few things to understand about it:
*This game is a copyright NIGHTMARE. I am not claiming any of the art, ideas, characters, or audio used here.
*The audio of the game is broken.
*The 9th character, Tsao Hu, is broken - the game will crash upon his selection.
